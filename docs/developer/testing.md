# Verification and local handoff

See the [documentation map](../index.md) for ownership, [usage](../operator/usage.md)
for operation, and [troubleshooting](../operator/troubleshooting.md) for recovery.

## Documentation completion check

Before declaring any sub-goal or milestone done, review developer and operator
guidance against implementation and actual results. Update commands, examples,
limitations, and status claims; separate fixture coverage from live checks.
Check relative file links, heading anchors, and consistency between entry points.
When adding or moving a guide, update the map and all old references. Keep
operator procedures in `docs/operator/`, developer guidance in `docs/developer/`,
and superseded material in the [archive](../archive/index.md).

Documentation-only changes need relevant CLI/example and link checks, not
invented runtime tests. Report blocked external link checks accurately; an HTTP
success alone does not establish that a source supports the associated claim.
See the [completion rule](../../AGENTS.md#finish-a-change).

## Checks that require no account

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
mix format --check-formatted
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
mix test
IPSE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) ./bin/ipse demo
```

Use focused tests during changes, then run the suite for a runtime handoff.
The suite exercises real filesystem and process behavior, local HTTP streaming,
OAuth validation with generated test keys, refresh serialization, skills,
journal recovery, approvals, and cancellation. HTTP fixtures bind to loopback;
Mix can also need local sockets. Initial dependency fetching needs network.
No real API keys or subscription are required. Auth transport injection is
compiled only for the test environment.

The demo is deterministic and does not call a model. It checks that the CLI,
session loop, skill loading, file tools, and native command helper work together.
Use its printed ID with `./bin/ipse chat --resume SESSION_ID` under the
same `IPSE_HOME`; `/session` should show the session without replaying tools.

## Release check

```sh
./scripts/package.sh
```

Extract the printed archive into an empty directory. Run `./ipse --help`
and `IPSE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) ./ipse demo` there. Do not rely on a source
checkout's `priv/` directory or build artifacts. Record OS, architecture, libc,
Elixir/OTP, and Rust versions with results. A release includes ERTS and the
native helper, but needs compatible system libraries.

From that extracted directory, also run the bundled helper checks:

```sh
./bin/ipse eval 'Code.require_file("verify-release.exs")'
```

This Elixir script verifies that runtime and application paths belong to the
extraction, exercises timeout and owner-death cleanup, and checks lock exclusion,
release on owner death, and inode preservation. The cleanup commands emit readiness
only after spawning their descendants, so the checks establish that work started
before cancellation or timeout. `./bin/ipse eval` is the bundled OTP launcher;
the root `./ipse` wrapper accepts Ipse CLI commands instead.
To prove independence from development tools, repeat help, demo, and helper
checks with Elixir, Erlang, Mix, and Rust executables absent from `PATH` while
retaining ordinary host shell utilities, including `sleep` for the helper check.

The packaging script copies the documentation tree recursively. When distributing
a release, set `IPSE_NOTICES_DIR` to a directory containing the bundled toolchain's
license notices; the packager copies these into `licenses/`. Building on one Linux
distribution does not establish compatibility with another distribution.
Inspect that directory in the extracted archive and record the supplied notice
sources and versions. Repackaging replaces the generated docs and licenses trees
so deleted material from an earlier build cannot survive there.

## Live provider acceptance

These checks are manual and use the account owner's authorization. Use a scratch
workspace and a small prompt. Record success/failure without credentials,
authorization URLs, tokens, private prompts, or full transcripts.

1. ChatGPT: browser login, status, streamed answer, tool-call round trip, resume,
   token refresh after expiry, and logout. Confirm account/model eligibility and
   that no API billing fallback occurs. Expiry/refresh must be tested with the
   live service before claiming the complete subscription lifecycle works.
2. OpenAI API: set the key securely; test streamed text and a tool round trip
   with `--provider openai`. This uses separate API billing.
3. Ollama: start the service and a tool-capable model; test text and a tool round
   trip with `--provider ollama`. Record the model/version and relevant hardware.
4. Anthropic API: test text, tool use, continuation, and a surfaced provider error
   with `--provider anthropic` and a key supplied securely.

## Current evidence and next checks

### Documentation restructure, 2026-10-14

Operator and developer guides now have separate directories, with a central
documentation map, dependency inventory, and historical archive. Verified 139
local file links and heading anchors across 24 Markdown documents, including
the archived snapshot. Checked active CLI commands against `./bin/ipse --help`
and the implementation. The 21 distinct public external links in active
documentation were reachable through HTTP checks or direct source retrieval;
reachability does not guarantee future availability. `git diff --check` passed.
These documentation-only changes introduced no runtime dependency; no runtime
suite or packaging rerun was required. The runtime evidence below is retained
from its actual checks.

### Initial Debian handoff

Initial handoff checks passed on Debian 13 Linux x86_64 (glibc 2.41),
Elixir 1.18.3 / OTP 27, Rust 1.85.1:

- Source build and compilation with warnings as errors.
- Elixir formatting and **49 tests, 0 failures**.
- Source CLI demo and interactive session resume without tool replay.
- Bundled release build; extracted CLI help and demo from a separate directory,
  without the development toolchain's library-path setting.
- No occurrences of the old project spelling in repository source or filenames.

### Arch source check, 2026-10-14

On Arch Linux x86_64, glibc 2.44, Elixir 1.20.4 / OTP 29 (ERTS 17.0.6),
Rust 1.99.0:

- Fixed Elixir 1.20 bitstring-size pin warnings in the native frame parser,
  SSE parser, and SSE fixture helper.
- Source build, formatting check, warnings-as-errors compilation, and all
  **51 tests passed** after the live fixes below. Tests use fixtures, not live
  model services.
- Source demo passed with isolated state under `/tmp`; interactive resume
  restored the idle session without replaying tools.
- The first sandboxed build failed because Mix's TCP lock returned `:eperm`.
  Build and checks passed with the required socket access outside that sandbox.
- Reviewed the implementation against official OpenAI
  [registration](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/sign-in),
  [session lifecycle](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/profiles-and-sessions),
  and [inference](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/models-and-inference)
  documentation. This is a source review, not live protocol verification.
- An initial browser callback connection refusal involved a stale callback
  port; a running login listened on a different port. A fresh matching attempt
  reached the listener. The precise cause of the initial stale URL is unknown.
- Fixed the real auth transport's strict `not uri.userinfo` check: normal URLs
  have `nil` userinfo, which raised before HTTP exchange. Public OpenID discovery
  then succeeded with TLS verification enabled. Added a real-transport URL
  credential rejection test; OAuth protocol fixtures still inject transport.
- Fixed the Responses adapter discarding streamed output items when the live
  `response.completed` event contained `output: []`. A regression fixture now
  covers text, tool calls, and opaque continuation retention in this case.

### Live ChatGPT subscription check, 2026-10-14

Verified with the account owner authorizing in Chrome on the same Arch machine:

- Fresh browser authorization, loopback callback, token exchange and signed
  identity validation completed. Status confirmed plan-usage permission; the
  credential file mode was `0600`.
- Explicit `chatgpt` provider with `gpt-6.1-sol` returned streamed text using the
  public Responses API with `store: false` and `stream: true`. No API provider
  or API key was selected.
- In a scratch workspace, individually approved `write`, `edit`, and `shell`
  calls created a small file, changed its contents, and read it through a shell
  command with exit code 0. Full proposed arguments appeared before approval.
- After closing and resuming the live session, the model recalled the file,
  final contents, and command result without tools. Journal tool-start counts
  remained three, confirming no replay.
- Logout returned success (remote revocation confirmed by the auth transport).
  Status then reported no session. Checked that access, refresh, and ID token
  fields were removed while client registration and host ID remained.

### Arch release and local provider checks, 2026-10-14

Built `ipse-0.1.0-linux-x86_64-glibc-2.44.tar.gz` on the Arch toolchain recorded
above. Fresh extraction under `/tmp` passed CLI help, credential-free demo, and
the bundled `verify-release.exs` checks. These ran with a utility-only `PATH`
containing no Elixir, Erlang, Mix, or Rust executables. The runtime and helper
resolved inside the extraction. This validates this host, not another Linux ABI.

An initial archive had only the generic Apache and Jason license texts. Rebuilt
with `IPSE_NOTICES_DIR` containing official upstream Elixir v1.20.4 and OTP
29.0.6 license trees, OTP/app authors, ERTS vendor license texts, and source
header/provenance inventories. Sources were tag commits
`759443e724f55bf58e71c0603644e99058918d52` (Elixir) and
`e07fd07837e5aa845657f5fa340637121e451d47` (OTP). Verified those files inside the
extracted archive. The header inventory includes upstream tests/examples;
it records provenance rather than certifying exactly which source files were
linked. No new build dependency was added.

Rebuilding initially retained stale documentation and notice files. After fixing
the packager to replace those generated directories, both sentinel checks passed.
Formatting, warnings-as-errors compilation, and all 51 fixture tests passed.

The installed Ollama-compatible service/client reported 0.40.1. A live
`qwen3.5:9b` read-tool round trip read the scratch file and returned its contents.
No model was downloaded. `ollama ps` reported the `llamacpp` runner, 4096 context,
and mixed CPU/GPU execution (28%/72%) on this host (Intel Core i7-12700K; NVIDIA
PCI vendor/device `10de:2486`). This is evidence for that local configuration,
not all models or hardware.

An intentionally unavailable ChatGPT model returned HTTP 400 under explicit
`chatgpt` selection; the failure surfaced without API provider fallback.

Natural-expiry refresh subsequently passed (see below). Broader plan eligibility,
live usage-limit errors, revoked-session
recovery, paid API calls, and macOS remain unverified. Successful fixture tests
do not establish live-service compatibility.

### HTTP lifecycle regression checks, 2026-10-14

Controlled CLI fixtures exposed a transport lifetime defect: standalone profiles
reused fixed names, and asynchronous shutdown could leave the old profile alive
or collide with the next request. Replaced the duplicate auth/provider lifecycle
code with guardian-owned leases from a fixed 64-name pool. Each guardian starts
its own linked profile, monitors the borrower, and waits for profile exit before
releasing the name. This adds no package dependency.

Four behavior tests verify completed-request cleanup, borrower-death cleanup,
overlapping requests with isolated options, and repeated active cancellation
closing both linked processes and actual loopback sockets before immediate reuse.
All **55 fixture tests passed**. The isolated five-test P1 CLI draft also passed
against this transport; that is preparation, not a claim that P1 UI work is done.

Priorities and completion criteria are in [plan.md](../plan.md). When reporting a
failure, include the command, toolchain, sanitized error, and whether it ran in
a sandbox. Avoid calling permission failures application regressions until
the same command has been checked with the required access.

### Live natural-expiry renewal, 2026-10-15

Waited for the original access-token expiry without changing its timestamp or
re-authorizing. After expiry, `Ipse.Auth.token/1` renewed the session: both access
and refresh tokens changed and expiry advanced. Registration, host, identity,
and plan permission were preserved; credential mode remained `600`.
A subsequent explicit ChatGPT `gpt-6.1-sol` request returned the expected text
in four streamed chunks. Logout succeeded and access/refresh/ID token fields
were cleared. The check used the normal protected account registration, kept
all secrets in memory/protected storage, and retained only sanitized booleans
and timestamps as evidence. This is live renewal evidence, separate from fixtures.
No API-billing fallback was enabled. Broader eligibility/usage-limit errors,
revoked-session recovery, paid API calls, and other platforms remain unverified.

### P1 CLI behavior, 2026-10-15

Six controlled CLI integration tests exercise the real CLI, session, HTTP
transport, and isolated journal homes with a loopback Ollama-protocol fixture.
They cover idle EOF, visible provider failure, running/finished states and
queued input at EOF, approval denial after EOF, resume preserving completed
write history without replay, and cancellation races. The cancellation check
forces repeated cancel and input arrival while cancellation is pending, proves
queued/discarded input is not sent, then completes a fresh turn in the same CLI.
No live model or account is used by these tests.

Build, formatting, warnings-as-errors compilation, all **61 tests**, and the
credential-free source demo passed. These checks do not establish live provider
compatibility beyond the separately recorded P0 account checks.

The rebuilt Arch bundle also passed help, credential-free demo, native timeout,
owner-death and lock checks, and HTTP-profile acquisition/cleanup from a fresh
extraction using a utility-only `PATH` without the development toolchain. A
source `chat --provider demo --yes` smoke check accepted two piped tasks and
finished both before exiting on EOF in an isolated scratch workspace. This is
scripted CLI evidence, not additional live model connectivity evidence.

### P1 runtime identity, 2026-10-15

Build, formatting, warnings-as-errors compilation, all **66 fixture tests**, and
the credential-free source demo passed. Added checks cover application version,
provider/model overrides, bounded invalid identifiers, missing/differing reported
models, secret exclusion, repeated-turn context, historical versus current-run
metadata after resume, and `/info` without inference while a request is pending.
Existing HTTP fixtures now assert runtime context survives serialization for
ChatGPT/OpenAI, Ollama, and Anthropic, and optional response metadata preserves
existing tool/continuation formats.

A separate live request to the already installed local Ollama `qwen3.5:9b`
returned application version `0.1.0`, configured provider `ollama`, and requested
model `qwen3.5:9b` from the supplied host facts. Resuming that scratch session
showed the saved provider-reported model in `/info`, with the current-run field
unavailable before inference. A plain “What version are you?” follow-up returned
`0.1.0`. No model was downloaded and no paid credentials were used. The new
identity behavior was not rechecked live with ChatGPT, OpenAI API, or Anthropic;
the earlier subscription lifecycle evidence remains separate.

The rebuilt Arch archive passed help, `/info` followed by EOF without inference,
credential-free demo, native timeout/owner-death/lock checks, and HTTP-profile
cleanup from a fresh extraction with a utility-only `PATH` containing no
development toolchain. `/info` showed bundled application version `0.1.0` and
explicit demo/scripted configuration. All 144 local documentation links/anchors
across 24 Markdown documents passed validation; developer/operator guidance was
reviewed against the implementation.

### Subsequent live ChatGPT identity, 2026-10-15

Reauthorized the same Ipse registration through the documented browser consent
flow. An explicit ChatGPT `gpt-6.1-sol` scratch session returned application
version `0.1.0`, provider `chatgpt`, requested model `gpt-6.1-sol`, and appropriately
unknown backend revision. `/info` after resume showed saved reported model
`gpt-6.1-sol` separately from unavailable current-run metadata, without inference.
No API provider or billing fallback was enabled.

### P2 context compaction, 2026-10-15

Build, formatting, warnings-as-errors compilation, all **78 tests**, and source
demo passed. Six helper tests cover safe boundaries, repeated compaction,
verbatim intent/action provenance, native recent continuation, old reasoning
exclusion from summary input, bounded/schema/tool-call rejection, stable JSON
digests, and disabled compaction. Five session integration tests cover durable
commit plus continuation, original journal retention and resume without replay,
cancellation before commit, owner death after commit, malformed summary recovery,
and rejection of corrupted committed checkpoints. Existing approval tests now
verify host-written decision/outcome metadata rather than inferring it from text.
A cancellation regression distinguishes approval-pending calls that never started
from executing calls whose effects may already have occurred.

A separate live ChatGPT scratch transcript with synthetic project facts compacted
from **29,490 to 3,358 bytes**. The resulting streamed reply (16 text chunks)
retained the project name `acorn` and MIT constraint. Exactly one checkpoint was
saved, all original messages remained, and no tools started. Resume retained
those facts without another compaction or tool execution. This is live evidence
for that account/model, separate from deterministic fixtures. Summary fidelity
is not proven generally; native OpenAI compaction and other providers' live
compaction behavior remain unverified. See [the contract](context-compaction.md).

The final compaction archive passed help, `/info`, `--context-bytes 8192` and
`--no-compact` parsing, credential-free demo, bundled compaction-module loading,
and native timeout/owner-death/lock checks from a fresh extraction with no
development toolchain on `PATH`. Developer/operator docs were reviewed and all
153 local links/anchors across 25 Markdown documents passed validation.

### Minimum-version formatter compatibility, 2026-10-15

GitHub CI for the identity and first compaction commits stopped at formatting
before behavior tests. Elixir 1.18 formatted two multiline tuple assertions
differently from Arch's 1.20. Rewrote those assertions to avoid that layout
ambiguity without changing their coverage. Formatting passes with both Arch
Elixir 1.20.4 and the official checksum-verified Elixir 1.18.4 OTP-27 build.
The latter was used for formatting only on the local OTP 29 host, not as proof
of the minimum runtime combination. All 11 affected provider fixtures passed
locally. The follow-up [GitHub Checks run](https://github.com/lexlapax/ipse/actions/runs/38703884589)
passed on the configured OTP 27 / Elixir 1.18 combination, including formatting,
all 78 tests, build, and demo.
